# Business Application Demos
You can build using the GeneroStudio project file businessApp.4pw

This demos also uses the g2_lib, njm_demo_db and dynMaint for the database and library code, so make sure to also check that out.

On Linux you can use the makefile to build and run using the businessApp.4pw
